		<h1 class="text-center">Welcome to the Austin Startup Games</h1>
		<p>The Austin Startup Games return to center stage at <a href="http://musichallaustin.com/">Austin Music Hall</a> on Saturday, January 25, 2014 at High Noon CST. Austin's Second Largest Startup Event (and largest "athletic event" for geeks) brings together 15 Austin Startups and countless hackers, hustlers and hipsters to benefit charities throughout Austin. </p>
		<p>The structure of the Startup Games is simple: Each team represents a charity and the team who wins the Games donates the most to their charity. How do you win the games, you ask? Simple. There are 10 (geek approved) athletic events where teams participate. Each win, show and place for a startup gains points and the team with the heighest average points at the end wins.</p>
		<p>The history of the Startup Games dates back to Ancient Greece and the inception of Gods and Men. Or 2011 at uShip World Headquarters. Our historian is a little fuzzy on some details. </p>
		<p>Austin Startup Games started in 2012 by 8 Austin startups who wanted to give back to the Austin community in a fun and a creative way.  After talking, drinking and debating what to do they finally came to a consensus and that's how Austin Startup Games was born. As one founding member stated - "Let's have a day of fun games that show the skills of our employees. We can raise money to donate to the charity of our choice and have the bragging rights that WE are the Champions!"</p>
 
		<p>We have now grown Austin Startup Games to hosting 16 startups in this half-day competition featuring ping pong, foosball, darts, shuffleboard, flip cup, beer pong, giant Connect4, Pop-A-shot and trivia.  Plus, the CEOs of each company compete in the final game (which is always a surprise and not revealed until moments before the game is to commence).  Last year it was a mechanical bull, what do you think we will put these CEOs through this year?!?</p>

		<p>Who will become Champion of Austin Startup Games 2014?!?! Come and see for yourself.</p>
